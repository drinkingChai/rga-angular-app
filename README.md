## Notes
My strength is in React, but I developed hobby projects with Angular 1.x about 2 years ago. I developed the project using React first, then learned Angular 5.x and TypeScript via the Angular docs over ~5 hours and completed the Angular version. The React version can be found below. Thank you!
